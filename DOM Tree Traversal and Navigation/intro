In this section you will learn how to move around the DOM using built‑in properties and methods. You’ll discover how to:
Navigate Relationships: Access parent, child, and sibling elements using properties like parentNode, firstChild/firstElementChild, lastChild/lastElementChild, nextSibling/nextElementSibling, and previousSibling/previousElementSibling.
Traverse Techniques: Loop through child nodes, filter by node type (to skip text nodes, for example), and recursively navigate nested structures.
Practical Use Cases: Update or style related elements by traversing from one node to another.
Learning Objectives:
Understand the hierarchical structure of the DOM.
Efficiently navigate between nodes.
Apply traversal methods in practical scenarios.
Below are 50 coding exercises with instructions, learning objectives, and starter code to help you master these techniques.
