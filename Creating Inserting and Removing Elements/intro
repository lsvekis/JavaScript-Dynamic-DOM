Modern web applications often require you to build and modify the document structure on the fly. In this section, you will learn how to:
Create Elements:
Use document.createElement to create new nodes, set their properties, and prepare them for insertion into the DOM.
Insertion Methods:
Add new elements into the DOM tree using methods such as:
appendChild: Adds a node as the last child of a parent.
insertBefore: Inserts a node before a reference node.
prepend: Adds a node as the first child (supported in modern browsers).
Removing & Replacing Elements:
Remove nodes with removeChild and replace them with replaceChild to update your document dynamically.
Using DocumentFragment:
When you need to insert many elements, using a DocumentFragment minimizes reflows and repaints for better performance.
Learning Objectives:
Create new DOM elements dynamically.
Learn various methods to insert, remove, and replace nodes.
Optimize DOM updates with DocumentFragments.
Now, letâ€™s work through 50 coding exercises that build your mastery of these techniques.
