In this section you will learn how to dynamically modify an element’s classes and inline styles to change its appearance and behavior. You will explore three key areas:
Class Management:
Learn how to add, remove, toggle, and check for classes on an element using the classList API. This is essential for dynamically applying CSS rules.
Inline Styling:
Directly update or read an element’s inline styles via the style property. This is useful for making quick style adjustments or animations without changing external CSS.
Computed Styles:
Use window.getComputedStyle to read the final, computed styles of an element. This helps you debug and adjust layouts by understanding which styles are actually being applied.
Learning Objectives:
Dynamically modify element classes to change styling and behavior.
Manage inline styles to alter an element’s appearance in real time.
Read computed styles for debugging and layout adjustments.
Below are 50 coding exercises that will help you master these techniques. Each exercise includes a learning objective, clear instructions, and starter code.
